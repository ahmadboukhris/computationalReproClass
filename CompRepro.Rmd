The first suggestion that Wilson et. al recommended was a better data management techniques to enable you and your collaborators to be more efficient and organized. Specifically, they mentioned keeping logs of what you are doing and why you are doing it, as well as keeping the raw data backed up on multiple sites. They also suggested having unique identifiers for every table for improved organization.



2) Please find the square root of 4 to the 13th power, writing your code in the gray box below so that it executes and provides the answer. Hit the play button to make sure it works:
